## Inspiration
As students faced with hybrid/online schooling, over the past 3 years, due to the Pandemic, watching hours of video lectures, can no doubt, be extremely daunting. Furthermore, post pandemic, the same goes for recorded lectures. As such, we've designed a convenient, intelligent solution. 

## What it does
LecSum, a website which produces textual summaries of video lectures, using the AssemblyAI API. 
Lecsum allows students to study smart, and save time, in which they can focus in academic pursuits elsewhere. 

## How we built it
We used AssemblyAI to convert the speech to text and then to summarize the text and generate chapters. The frontend was developed using React and the web app was deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Challenges we ran into:
Our main challenge arose whilst coding the backend i.e. implementing the backend with Cockroach DB. Unfortunately, the timeframe was too short to completely understand and implement it, error-free. However, this is something that we look forward to learning and would like to use it in the future.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was the first time we worked with an Artificial Intelligence API and so we are quite proud of how we were able to build a functioning product with reasonable accuracy in such a short amount of time.

## What we learned
We learned how to use third-party APIs to make complex tasks easy to implement. We also learned how to design UIs in Figma and then implement them using React. 

## What's next for LecSum
- Allowing users to create accounts and the ability to save all their summarized lectures in their profile.
- Real-time speech to text transcription and summarization. 
- Extend the app (make it more general), to allow summarizations of meetings etc. 
- add in the cohere AI API.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
